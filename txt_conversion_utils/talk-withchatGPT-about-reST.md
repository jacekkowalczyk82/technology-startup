Introduction
============

This is a sample reST manual. It demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of reST files.

Section 1: Required Tools
=========================

You will need to download two things:

- Pandoc: You can download it from the official website: https://pandoc.org/
- AsciiDoctor: You can download the Java binding (asciidoctorj) from: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj

Section 2: Conversion to PDF
============================

The conversion from asciidoc file to PDF is very simple:

.. code-block:: bash

   asciidoctorj.bat -b pdf input-file.adoc

Section 3: Conversion to DOCX
=============================

The conversion from asciidoc file to DOCX requires to use both tools:

.. code-block:: bash

   asciidoctorj.bat -b docbook input-file.adoc
   pandoc.exe -s  -r docbook -t docx -o my-DOXC-document.docx input-file.xml

```

This is a very basic example. reStructuredText supports a wide range of features, including tables, images, footnotes, citations, mathematical equations, and much more. You can find more information in the official reStructuredText documentation: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Introduction
============

This is a simple manual to help you get started with reStructuredText (reST), a markup language used for technical documentation.

Section 1: Installation
=======================

Before you can start writing in reST, you need to install a reST processor. The most common one is Docutils, which you can install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install docutils

Section 2: Basic Syntax
=======================

Here are some basic reST syntax:

- Headers are created by underlining (and optionally overlining) the text with a punctuation character. For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

     ==========
     My Header
     ==========

- Bullet lists are created by placing a '*', '+' or '-' at the start of a line. For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

     * Item 1
     * Item 2

- Numbered lists are created by placing a number followed by a period at the start of a line. For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

     1. Item 1
     2. Item 2

- Inline emphasis can be added with '*' (for italics) and '**' (for bold). For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

     *This text will be italic*
     **This text will be bold**

Section 3: Generating Documentation
===================================

Once you have written your reST document, you can use Docutils to generate a HTML document:

.. code-block:: bash

   rst2html.py input.rst output.html

This will generate a HTML document named `output.html` from your reST document.

Conclusion
==========

This is a very basic introduction to reST. reST supports a wide range of features, including tables, images, footnotes, citations, mathematical equations, and much more. You can find more information in the official reStructuredText documentation: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

## What tools I can use for generating docx files from reST format ?

You can use Pandoc, a universal document converter, to convert reStructuredText (reST) files to DOCX format. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install Pandoc from the official website: https://pandoc.org/

2. Use the following command to convert a reST file to a DOCX file:

```bash
pandoc -s -f rst -t docx -o output.docx input.rst

C:\dev\install\pandoc\pandoc-3.2\pandoc.exe  -s -f rst -t docx -o basic-01.docx basic-01.rst
```

In this command, `-s` stands for standalone (meaning the output should be a standalone document rather than a fragment of a document), `-f rst` specifies the input format (reST in this case), `-t docx` specifies the output format (DOCX in this case), `output.docx` is the name of the output file, and `input.rst` is the name of the input file.

Please replace `input.rst` and `output.docx` with the actual names of your input and output files.

  .. code-block:: rst

     *This text will be italic*
     **This text will be bold**

- Tables can be created using the 'grid' directive. For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

     +------------+------------+
     | Header 1   | Header 2   |
     +============+============+
     | cell 1     | cell 2     |
     +------------+------------+

Section 3: Generating Documentation
===================================

Once you have written your reST document, you can use Docutils to generate a HTML document:

.. code-block:: bash

   rst2html.py input.rst output.html

This will generate a HTML document named `output.html` from your reST document.
